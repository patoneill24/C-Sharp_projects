# C# Projects

### About

Here is a repository of console applications that I developed for a C# class. Some of the projects include 
a journal app, a scripture-memorizer app, a mental-health app, a goal tracker app, and a homework assignment tracker application. All
of these applications are written in C#, and utilize import object oriented programming principles such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. Most of the 
projects are in the prove folder, except for the homework assignment tracker application which is in the final folder.
